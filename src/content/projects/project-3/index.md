Developed a full-stack social media platform designed to foster real-time interactions and community building. This platform allows users to:

- Express Themselves: Share their thoughts and experiences through posts.
- Build Connections: Follow other users to stay updated with their content.
- Engage with Content: Like posts and explore user profiles to discover new connections and interests.

The backend is powered by Spring Boot, ensuring a robust and scalable server-side application. The frontend is built with React, offering a responsive and dynamic user experience. For data storage and management, MongoDB is utilized, providing a flexible and efficient NoSQL database solution.

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate multiple technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience.
